<h4>
	What I think
</h4>
<p>
    The dark story, the beutiful background, the boss fight are the reasons I bought the games."Your died"often pop on my screen, sometimes I feel tired to try, but I always found the enthusiasm to play.The accomplishment from defeating the boss really give me a lot of happiness.Now,I am stuck in the one of the hardest boss fight in the game,maybe I can pass for trying about 50 times.
