    <h5>
    	What I think
    </h5>
    <p style="color:white;">
    	His game is hard, but if you can stand for dyng again and again to do research on the bossess' actions,it is not that hard.When you are fighting,your movement is very realistic and you do not really have a cool moves plus the fantastic hit effect.You can feel yourself are in the game fighting.Also,the difficulty is not harder and harder, so every time you meet a new mob,bring players a curiosity.
    	<br>
    	The map in his game is designed very well, you aleays do not know where does the door lead you to,and there are many important things about the world and the story,let you combine the pieces into a whole story
    	<br>
    	There is a feature in his game,traps is everywhere,from behind the door,to trap treasure box.It can give you a lot of surprise.
    	<br>
    	In the Souls series,every main characters is not special.He is a nobody in the big world,but he just accidentally has the mission to finish passing the fire.Even you finish the game,choose to pass the fire,you can not get anything,no one know who you are and do not want to khow.In Dark Souls III,you are combination of ember,the undead that failed to pass the fire and burn into ashes,inherit everything in the past and finish the history.
