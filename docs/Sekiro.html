    <h4>
    	What I think
    </h4>
    <p>
    	The human-type mob fight is really intense.The sound that the katana made is awesome.The game is really hard before you are used to fight,because it is very different compare to his game before(I played Dark Souls III).I have not finish the game,but I am sure I can finish the game faster than Dark Souls III,because I really like Japan's culture,the background,the style,really attract me a lot.
